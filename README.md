# codecademyFullStackProjects
This repo contains exercising projects I worked through while getting through the **Full-Stack Engineer Path** of [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com).

_Files which I mainly created or modified myself_ are prefixed with my initials **_ah_** (for Andi Hafner), while the original template files remain as they are.
Files with only minor changes (e.g. just with a modified external reference) aren't renamed usually.

The projects are organized in subfolders, while tracked by git from the root folder, as I don't like to overcharge my github account with too many repositories,  therefore project related commit messages usually have the structure '**_ahProjectName[\_fileName]_**: commit message'.
