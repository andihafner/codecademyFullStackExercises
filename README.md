# codecademyFullStackProjects
This repo contains exercising projects I worked through while getting through the full stack engineering path of codecademy.com.

_Files which I mainly created or modified myself_ are prefixed with my initials **_ah_** (for Andi Hafner), while the original template files remain as they are.
Files with only minor changes (e.g. just with a modified external reference) aren't renamed usually.

The projects are organized in subfolders, while tracked by git from the root folder, therefore the commit message usually have the structure '**_ahProjectName_fileName_**: commit message'.
